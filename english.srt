1
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,690
Flesh? and sin die.

2
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,410
Die with Christ, that's it.
Rise with Christ.

3
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,660
That's it. Holy Spirit, come.
Holy Spirit come, set her free.

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,080
Die with Christ.

5
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,430
Holy Spirit, more.

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,110
Come with your Holy Spirit.
Fill me up.

7
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,110
Just words started coming.

8
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,160
Thank you, Lord!

9
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,760
What was I doing?
- What?

10
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,100
What was I doing?

11
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,040
What you were doing?
You were praying in tongues.

12
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,390
Does it hurt?
- No.

13
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,350
Not at all?
- No.

14
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,650
In Jesus' name,
I thank you. Amen.

15
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,630
It's done!
Hallelujah!

16
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,030
...over one month
and she is in shock.

17
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,460
It's Jesus.

18
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,010
I used to watch
these things on TV

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,640
and sometimes I do not believe,
but today I do believe

20
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,930
because it happens to me.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,710
Pain, go now.

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,840
And you can do this.
Now get all up.

23
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,520
It's good, yeah?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you Father. Amen.
Try to feel it.

25
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,340
Can you feel any difference?

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Seriously, it does not hurt anymore.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,470
Wow!

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,330
God, I thank you for healing. Thank you,
the pain is going to go.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Try to feel the head.

30
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,580
No!
I don't feel no pain, bro.

31
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,570
Now the pain is gone.
Now the pain is gone, yes.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,970
We, as the church today, are standing
in front of a new reformation.

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,180
A reformation,
where we are coming back

34
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,720
to what we read
in the Book of Acts.

35
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,470
If you look at the church today,

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,000
it is so different from what we read
in the Book of Acts.

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,400
Because we have like
2000 years of history,

38
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,880
where the church has been changed
again and again.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,030
We can see that the church
in the Book of Acts was a living body.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,060
It was a body of believers
who were led by the Holy Spirit.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
The church was a movement,
a disciples' movement.

42
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,650
Christianity moved to Greece
and became a philosophy.

43
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,040
It came to Italy and
became an institution.

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,420
It came to Europe and
became a culture.

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,680
It came to America and
became a business.

46
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,830
If you take a body and make
a business out of a body

47
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,460
is that not prostitution?

48
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,630
And this is what we have done
today with the church.

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,620
We have prostituted the church
of Christ, the body of Christ.

50
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,930
Because of that, we need
to see a reformation,
